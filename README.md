## The target of DSSL model
To detect the structural changes in a real-time manner.

## Definition of structural changes
We refer to the change in linear relationship as a structural change, i.e., change of the manifold structure capturing the linear relationship among the high-dimensional streaming data. 

Figure 1 is a simple example with three time series illustrating the concept of structural change. In Figure 1(a), there are two change-points, i.e., t=1000 and 2000. Once a change-point occurs, the linear relationship among these variables changes, e.g., from Z=X-Y to Z=4X+2Y at t=1000. Figure 1(b) shows the time series in a three-dimensional space. Clearly, each segment in Figure 1(a) corresponds to a plane or a linear manifold in Figure 1(b), and we can easily see the transition from one to another.

## Main ideas
+ Use LASSO to estimate the self-representive coefficients based on the Sparse Subspase Clustering (SSC) assumptions;
+ Use PELT algorithm to make online detection.

More details could be found in the paper.

## Simulation Study
Two subspaces are simulated, where the first half of these time series are generated by linearly combining three B-spline basis functions, while the other half is generated by Fourier basis functions. The length of the time series is set to N=128 and suppose there are two change-points at 32 and 64 respectively. The dimension is set to p=40, i.e., 20 time series for each subspace.

Figure 2 shows the mean and confidence interval of the detected LCP (latest change-point) at each time step. It can be clearly seen that in most of the cases, the change can be timely detected with only about 10 time steps after the change occurs. Besides, as the observations since the latest change accumulates, the detected location of the LCP becomes more and more accurate.

Figure 3 shows the estimated coefficients at the final time step for the first three time series of each subspace for illustration. These coefficients change at two change-points. Only the time series within the same subspace have nonzero coefficients, and each representation is sparse. These coefficients are constant within each segment.

## Future Work
+ Variance heterogeneity or auto-correlation;
+ Nonlinear regressions such as kernel based methods;
+ Improve the formulation of the SSC optimization;
+ Graph models.
