   The Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 Kinect gesture data set consists of sequences of human movements, represented as body-part locations, and the associated gesture to be recognized by the system. The data set includes 594 sequences and 719,359 frames—approximately six hours and 40 minutes—collected from 30 people performing 12 gestures. In total, there are 6,244 gesture instances. The motion files contain tracks of 20 joints estimated using the Kinect Pose Estimation pipeline. The body poses are captured at a sample rate of 30Hz with an accuracy of about two centimeters in joint positions.
